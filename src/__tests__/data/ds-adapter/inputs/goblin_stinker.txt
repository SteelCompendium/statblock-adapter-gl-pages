Effect The area is filled with a green haze until the start of the 
stinker’s next turn or until the stinker is reduced to Stamina 0. 
The area is difficult terrain for non-goblin creatures, and each 
such creature who moves within the area takes 2 poison 
damage for each square moved. The haze can’t be dispersed by 
wind.
