Solo Turns The werewolf takes up to two turns each round. They 
can’t take turns consecutively.
End Effect At the end of their turn, the werewolf can take 5 
damage to end one save ends effect affecting them. This 
damage can’t be reduced in any way.
Shapeshifter
The werewolf enters combat in their hybrid humanoid form. Their 
shape can’t change via any effects beyond their own ability.
Shared Ferocity
The Director gains 1d3 malice the first time a creature uses an 
ability that costs ferocity while within line of effect of the 
werewolf.
Accursed Rage
The werewolf’s ferocity is expressed through rage. Their abilities 
are capable of inflicting rage points on enemies (excluding 
stormwight furies). 
If a creature has 10 or more rage at the start of their turn, they 
expend all of their rage, shift up to their speed towards the 
nearest creature, and make a melee free strike against them. A 
creature that takes damage in this way gains 1 rage. All 
accumulated rage disappears after completing a respite.
